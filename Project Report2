Second Increment Report

Modeling and validation of domain ontology and inference cases

The model has been modified a bit. The Parent Class has 2 subclasses, “Mother” and “Father”. The Child Class has “Boy” and “Girl” as other two subclasses. Monthly Report Class contains “Meeting Reminder”, ”Holidays/School Closing”, ”ParentsNightOutReminder” and “Fee Reminder”.
Daily Report includes several Activities. Yearly reports include overall performance of a child and holidays. The below screen shot shows my updated version of TeaParting System (Teacher to Parent Reporting System). 3 types of reports can be generated for each child by a teacher.  These are 
Daily, Monthly and Yearly. 

 



Properties: A “HasChild” and “HasParent” are inverse to each other.  The below screen shot shows the newly added properties

i.  A Parent can have name, Email ID and Phone number.
Hence the communication between teacher and parent happens through email ID.
ii.  A Parent “HasChild”, can be a Boy or Girl or both of them 
iii.  A child can be a boy or girl can have Name, Age, Mother and Father.
iv.  Monthly Report includes Meeting Reminder”, ”Holidays/School Closing”, ”ParentsNightOutReminder” and “Fee Reminder” which will be sent by the Teacher to the Parent on Monthy basis.  Yearly Report will be updated in next increment report.













SWRL Rules and Inference Cases
 



 


Inference Cases:
i.  A child has Father
ii.   A child has Mother
iii.  A child (Boy or Girl) can have a brother as sibling
iv.  A child (Boy or Girl) can have a sister as sibling.
v.  A parent can have an Email ID as a part of details class but should end with “.com”
vi.  A parent can have a Phone number but should start with “+”

SPARQL queries and query results

Query using a Property “HasChild”

 
Using the Keyword “OPTIONAL”:  I have provided value for Email_ID ( Susanatyahoo.com) and Name (Amy) for Teacher instance in my Ontology for testing purpose.
 

 

 


Using LIMIT
 



Using UNION & FILTER
 

 








Diagrams
Used Visual Paradigm for generating Class diagram and Sequence Diagram 

 


Sequence diagram (using Visual Paradigm)


 








Class Diagram using Visual Paradigm: Mother and Father Classes are generalized subclasses of Parent Class. There is an association between Parent Class and Child Class.
 

Below screen shot shows the subclasses of class “Reports” in the above diagram.
 





WSDLs (Web Service Description Language)

 


Modeling of ontologies, rules, queries

Retrieving all the classes and Instances.
 
 

SPARQL query:

String queryString = " PREFIX rdfs:<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> "
          + " PREFIX xmlns:<http://www.owl-ontologies.com/OntologyTeaRepo.owl#>"
   + " SELECT ?y " + " WHERE { " + "xmlns:"+ ClassName + " " + "xmlns:HasName ?y" +" }";













Implementation of services 
Implemented using SPARQL query. The SPARQL query that I used is mention below.
String queryString = " PREFIX rdfs:<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> " + " PREFIX xmlns:<http://www.owl-ontologies.com/OntologyTeaRepo.owl#>"
   + " SELECT ?Teacher " + " WHERE { " + "xmlns:"+ ClassName + " " + "xmlns:Teaches ?x" +" }"; 


 














Implementation of user interface (Mobile Apps)

This login box will accept username or email ID and a password. This login box has user name and password to sign in. When the close “X” is hit, the login box closes and the background will become normal. A screen shot is provided below.













If user name enters a wrong password/username/email, an error in displayed.

 

Once a right user name and password are given, a preschool daily activity report page is displayed (teacher to parent report). I have created actual format of my Daily Activity Reporting in the TeaParting System.
This is Kids daily activity report that would help a parent to know about his day to day activities in the school. 
It also shows whether the preschooler has participated in each and every activity. If he/she has participated, the teacher can check the “participated”. A screen shot is provided below

Implementation status report 

Work completed
Description: SWRL rules, new properties are included in the OWL file. Daliy Report Activity implementation is completed. 
Responsibility: Each and every phase is done by Deepthi
Time taken: More than 5 days
Contributions: Single/Individual


Work to be completed
Description:  Implementing Jquery mobile for Monthly report and yearly report are left to be completed. My web service is still displaying errors. So it should be implemented properly. I will try to complete before 3rd Increment
Responsibility: Every task will be done by Deepthi.
Time to be taken: Approximately 1 week.
